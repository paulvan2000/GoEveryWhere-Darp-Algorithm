Dial-a-Ride (DAR) Routing with OR-Tools
=======================================

This project demonstrates a **dial-a-ride** or **on-demand** transit algorithm using OR-Tools from Google. It features:

-   **Wide Time Windows** to avoid infeasibility
-   **No Request Skipping** (all requests must be served)
-   **Accessibility Requirements** (bike/wheelchair) for both vehicles and passengers
-   **Multiple Vehicle** support, with the option to use one or many vehicles

The code generates test scenarios, solves the routing problem, produces charts and tables for analysis, and saves interactive maps in HTML.

1\. How the Algorithm Works
---------------------------

1.  **Data Generation**

    -   We create a set of requests (each request has a pickup location, dropoff location, time window, and potential accessibility needs like "needs_bike" or "needs_wheelchair").
    -   We also create multiple vehicles, each with capacity and random capabilities (bike-capable, wheelchair-accessible).
2.  **Routing Model (OR-Tools)**

    -   We use a **RoutingIndexManager** and **RoutingModel** to set up the problem.
    -   **Pickup-and-Delivery** constraints ensure that each request's pickup happens before its dropoff on the same vehicle.
    -   **Time Windows** ensure the pickup and dropoff happen within the allowed time range (though we made these windows wide to reduce infeasibility).
    -   **Capacity Constraints** ensure vehicles do not exceed their passenger limit.
    -   **Accessibility Constraints** ensure a passenger needing a bike/wheelchair can only be assigned to a vehicle that supports that feature.
3.  **Search Parameters**

    -   **First-Solution Strategy**: PATH_CHEAPEST_ARC
    -   **Local-Search Metaheuristic**: GUIDED_LOCAL_SEARCH
    -   **Time Limit**: 30 seconds (configurable)
4.  **Solution Extraction**

    -   OR-Tools returns a solution specifying the route for each vehicle.
    -   We calculate the total distance and approximate simulation time (assuming 30 mph average).

2\. Test Scenarios & Results
----------------------------

We tested **three scenarios** (see `TEST_CONFIGS` in code):

1.  **Req20_Veh4_Reg0.1**
    -   20 requests
    -   4 vehicles
    -   Region size: Â±0.1Â°
2.  **Req30_Veh6_Reg0.2**
    -   30 requests
    -   6 vehicles
    -   Region size: Â±0.2Â°
3.  **Req10_Veh2_Reg0.05**
    -   10 requests
    -   2 vehicles
    -   Region size: Â±0.05Â°

### 2.1 High-Level Results

Below is the raw table of results (distance in miles, sim_time in minutes):

| Config | NumRequests | NumVehicles | RegionSize | distance_miles | sim_time_min |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Req20_Veh4_Reg0.1 | 20 | 4 | 0.10 | 73.376 | 146.752 |
| Req30_Veh6_Reg0.2 | 30 | 6 | 0.20 | 194.668 | 389.336 |
| Req10_Veh2_Reg0.05 | 10 | 2 | 0.05 | 26.601 | 53.202 |

-   **Total Distance**: For each scenario, we sum the route distances for all vehicles.
-   **Simulation Time**: We assume 30 mph average speed, so `distance_miles / 30 * 60`.

### 2.2 Basic Charts

**Total Distance vs. Scenario** (left) and **Simulation Time vs. Scenario** (right):

![Grouped Bar Chart](grouped_comparison.png)

-   The scenario with 30 requests and region size 0.2 has the highest distance/time (as expected).
-   The smallest scenario (10 requests, 2 vehicles, region size 0.05) is the most compact.

### 2.3 Additional Analysis

The code also generates extra charts for deeper insights:

1.  **Distance per Vehicle**
2.  **Stops per Vehicle**
3.  **Accessibility Demand vs. Supply**
4.  **Distribution of Route Segment Distances**
5.  **Load Over Route Order** (passenger count at each step)

For example:

-   **Load Over Route Order**\
    ![Load Over Route Order](load_over_route.png)

-   **Distribution of Route Segment Distances**\
    ![Segment Distance Histogram](segment_distance_hist.png)

-   **Accessibility Demand vs. Supply**\
    ![Accessibility Demand vs Supply](./Algorithms/accessibility_demand_vs_supply.png)

These charts let us see how balanced the routes are, how far each vehicle travels, and whether the algorithm has enough bike/wheelchair-capable vehicles to meet demand.

3\. Map Visualization
---------------------

The solution also generates interactive Folium maps (HTML files) showing each vehicle's route.

-   **Always-Visible Labels**: We use `DivIcon` to show each stop's info without hovering.
-   **Bike/Wheelchair** icons: We add "ðŸš²" or "â™¿" for pickups that need them.

**Example**:

`<!-- routes_Req20_Veh4_Reg0.1_20250321_100928.html -->`

### Embedding Maps with IFrames

If you want to embed these map files directly in your README (or an HTML report), you can do something like:

`<h2>Routes for Req20_Veh4_Reg0.1</h2>
<iframe src="Maps/routes_Req20_Veh4_Reg0.1_20250321_100928.html"
        width="1000" height="600">
</iframe>`

Adjust the filename, width, and height as needed. In GitHub's Markdown, iframes are often **not** allowed in `.md` files, but you can do this in an HTML file or a Jupyter notebook.


4\. How to Run
--------------

1.  **Install Dependencies**

    -   `pip install ortools folium osmnx networkx haversine matplotlib pandas`
2.  **Run in a Jupyter Notebook**

    -   Just open the `.ipynb` file (or paste the code) and run the cells.
    -   The code automatically displays the maps inline if `IN_JUPYTER` is true.
3.  **Run as a Python Script**

    -   `python main.py`
    -   This will generate the maps as `.html` files, a `results.html` page, and a series of PNG charts.

5\. Future Improvements
-----------------------

-   **Vehicle Usage Cost**: If we want to encourage using multiple vehicles, add a fixed cost per vehicle so the solver chooses more vehicles if it shortens overall routes.
-   **Time Window Slack**: We could measure how close pickups/dropoffs are to their time-window boundaries.
-   **Realistic Speeds/Delays**: We might factor in slower speeds or random traffic delays.
-   **Skipping with Penalties**: If we want partial coverage, reintroduce "skippable" requests with a penalty.
